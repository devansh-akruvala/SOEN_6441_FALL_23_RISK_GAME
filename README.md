# Problem Statement 
## Build 1 
Implemented a preliminary version of the computer game "WarZone - Risk" . The created application has to operate according to the "Warzone" version that may be downloaded from https://www.warzone.com, including the rules, map files, and command-line play. A linked network map of the world, where each node is a country and each edge indicates an adjacency between countries, serves as the basis for the Warzone game setting. In order to play, two or more players must place troops on the countries they control from which they can invade and conquer neighboring countries. To conquer every nation on the map is the game's goal.
